Schrodinger's Cat Game

Interactive game aimed at outreach for aspiring physicists in school to get them interested and thinking about the quirky features of Quantum Mechanics such as superposition and the concept of Schrodinger's Cat. Developed using Python and the Pygame library during the Hello World Hackathon event (February 2020) in a team of 3 (Joseph Sleiman, Lucas Schon & Philip Abramson) wherin we won the overall best prize and the best physics outreach project.

Run the game in terminal using 'python3 Schrodinger.py'

Game uses arrow keys to move Schrodinger's Cat around the box. Tap 'A' to collapse into the 'Alive' state where you can move Schrodinger's Cat faster. Tap 'D' to collapase into the 'Dead' state where you can slow down time. Tap 'S' to revert back to the state of superposition - both 'Dead' and 'Alive'. Avoid the radioactive particles for as long as possible.
